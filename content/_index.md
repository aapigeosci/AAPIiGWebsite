  ![AAPIIG front image.](aapiig-website-front-page-4_2021.png)


  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in Geosciences (AAPIIG) is a grassroots, member-driven organization committed to building a community that supports AAPIs within geosciences.

  We welcome all geosciences community members who self-identify as Asian American and/or Pacific Islander, as well as individuals of Asian- and/or Pacific Islander-descent working in U.S.-based institutions. Community members include undergraduates, graduate students, recent graduates in transition, post-baccalaureate, and prospective students, postdocs, faculty, educators, administrators, international scholars, industry and non-profit professionals, federal or state employees, researchers, retirees, and more.
