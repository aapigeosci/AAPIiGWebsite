  **Format:** Hybrid

  **Location:** Online and Convention Center Room 350-351

  **Description:** [Abstract link](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Session/118700). Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in Geosciences (AAPIiG) is a grassroots, member-driven organization committed to building a community that supports AAPIs within geosciences. Launched during AGU Fall Meeting 2020, we are a new organization seeking to foster a sense of community among AAPI geoscientists; empower current and future AAPI geoscientists in their career goals; embrace the diversity of both historical and contemporary experiences encompassed by communities grouped together by the AAPI categorization; and advocate for justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion issues in solidarity with other marginalized groups. This Town Hall will provide details on the vision, organization, and progress of our group thus far, as well as a space to solicit feedback on effective programming for AAPIiG going forward. This Town Hall will start with an update from AAPIiG leadership and a brief look at demographic data related to AAPI geoscientists currently provided by AGU, NSF and other organizations. There will also be ample opportunity for audience Q&A with the AAPIiG steering committee. We welcome all geosciences community members, including allies and especially those who self-identify as AAPI or individuals of Asian- and/or Pacific Islander-descent working in U.S.-based institutions, to join us.

  <summary>&nbsp;<b>May 27</b> - Panel: International Scholars in Geosciences</summary>

  ![Allyship as AAPI geoscientists image](img/2022_AANHPI_Heritage_Month_international_scholars_panel.png)

  **Date:** May 27, 2022

  **Format:** Virtual

  **Location:** Zoom

  **Description:** A panel event featuring three early-career oceanographers speaking on the topic of International Scholars in the Earth Sciences: Dr. Alejandra Sanchez-Rios, Dr. Yige Zhang and Dr. Yackar Mauzole. Conversations and scholarship about race and structural inequity in United States academic science typically focus on U.S.-born students and scholars, for whom there is more longitudinal data collected. Immigrant scholars have distinct career narratives from U.S.-born students and scholars of color, while representing a substantial proportion of non-white geoscientists working in the U.S. This panel aimed to spotlight these experiences by bringing together three earth scientists who have had transnational careers, so that attendees left with insights into how international scholar experiences interplay with efforts to diversity STEM.
