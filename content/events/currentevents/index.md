- [Register and learn more](https://tinyurl.com/aapiig-career)
- This panel discussion is designed to showcase individuals who have leveraged their academic training to transition into careers in government, industry, and nonprofit sectors. As new industries and technologies come onboard, our field is rapidly evolving and new career prospects are opening outside of universities and research-based work. We envision this event as a resource for students and early-career researchers during these current times of rapidly changing outlooks on faculty and federal government hiring, and it will have a portion of time designated for audience Q&A.
- Panelists:
  - **Dr. Byron Winston** is an Environmental Scientist with a proven track record of 15+ years managing and executing environmental projects in lakes, rivers, and contaminated groundwater. He currently leads AECOM's Algae to Sustainable Agriculture program, pioneering the use of algae as a sustainable fertilizer supplement to enhance soil carbon sequestration, improve water quality, and mitigate harmful algal blooms. Dr. Winston received his Bachelors from  Midwestern State University in 2003, and Masters and PhD from University of Arkansas in Cell and Molecular Biology and Environmental Dynamics respectively.
  - **Dr. Sophie Chu** is the principal oceanographer and director of monitoring, reporting, and verification at Captura, a marine carbon dioxide removal startup company based in Pasadena, CA. She has spent over a decade developing and testing ocean carbon sensor technology to better understand carbon cycling. Prior to joining Captura, Sophie was a research scientist at the University of Washington and NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Lab in Seattle, WA. Sophie has her B.S. in chemical engineering from Columbia University and Ph.D. in chemical oceanography from MIT and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
  - **Dr. Kieron Prince**, Associate Professor of Geology at Broward College, is a first-generation college student and immigrant with a passion for teaching. Dr. Prince received his BSc from Loma Linda University in 2013, his MSc from Baylor University in 2015, and a PhD from Texas A&M University in 2020, where his research investigated the impacts of strong ocean-bottom currents on the alteration of carbonate sediments. 
  - **Dr. Susan Park** is the Executive Director of the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF), an international scientific society dedicated to advancing the understanding and wise stewardship of estuarine and coastal ecosystems worldwide. Prior to this appointment, Susan was the Associate Director of Virginia Sea Grant, based at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and College of William & Mary; Senior Program Officer with the Ocean Studies Board of The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine; Adjunct Professor at Trinity Washington University; and NOAA Coastal Management Fellow with the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management. Susan received her PhD in Oceanography from the University of Delaware, and her MA and BA in Biology from the University of Pennsylvania.

**Date:**
Thursday, May 9, 2024; 3:30 PM Eastern/12:30 PM Pacific/9:30 AM Hawaiʻi

**Description:**
This will be a 90 minute virtual webinar and is open to the public. We are featuring three AANHPI natural disaster experts who will discuss disaster risk and community impacts, equitable recovery following natural disasters, and hazard communication with the public and decision-makers. Our goal is to showcase scientists who have developed tangible connections between their research, affected communities and decision-makers.

**Panelists:**
- Dr. Robby Goldman is a GSA-USGS Congressional Fellow working in the office of U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. Dr. Goldman’s responsibilities include monitoring Maui's post-wildfire-disaster recovery and exploring federal policies to mitigate Hawaii's risk for future wildfires.

# AAPIiG APA Heritage Month Panel: Allyship as AAPI Geoscientists

![Image showing information about a panel on Allyship as AAPI Geoscientists.](panel1Poster.png)

**Description:**
In this panel, we bring previous speakers for the Virtual ECR Lunch series to highlight a specific part of their experience as AAPI geoscientists: being allies for other marginalized groups, in addition to fellow AAPIs, within the geosciences.

# AAPIiG APA Heritage Month Panel: International Scholars in Geosciences

**Description:**
Conversations and scholarship about race and structural inequity in United States academic science typically focus on U.S.-born students and scholars, for whom there is more longitudinal data collected. Immigrant scholars have distinct career narratives from U.S.-born students and scholars of color, while representing a substantial proportion of non-white geoscientists working in the U.S. This panel aims to spotlight these experiences by bringing together three earth scientists who have had transnational careers. We hope attendees will come away with insight into how international scholar experiences interplay with efforts to diversity STEM.
