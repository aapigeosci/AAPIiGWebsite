Thank you for your interest in the AAPIiG community. As part of [our mission](/whoweare/ourmission), we aim to create a place where all members feel safe, included, and able to particulate as their whole selves. As an affinity space, we recognize that everyone is at different stages of identity formation, especially as it pertains to our role as geoscientists. We strive to make AAPIiG an organization that fosters environments where this lifelong journey of learning and introspection may occur.

To ensure the best possible experience for all participants, we have established some basic guidelines for all conduct in spaces where the AAPIiG community congregates, whether online or in-person. This document is a living document and subject to amendments in the future as societal ethics continue to evolve.

By joining or participating in AAPIiG activities, you agree that you have read and will follow these guidelines. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate a participant’s ability to engage in AAPIiG events and spaces if they violate these rules.

If you have questions about these rules, the community, or how you can participate, please contact a Community Administrator.

**All participants are to:**

- Use their true identity, especially in online spaces;
- Be treated with respect and consideration;
- Be considerate, collegial, and collaborative;
- Communicate openly, with civil attitudes, critiquing ideas rather than individuals;
- Respect the privacy of fellow community members by not sharing details outside the group without explicit permission;
- Avoid personal attacks; and
- Alert organizers if you notice someone in distress, or perceive a potentially dangerous situation, or witness a dangerous situation.

**Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language;
- Speaking from one’s own personal experiences and perspectives (“I” instead of “they,” “we,” “you,” etc.);
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences;
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism;
- Focusing on what is best for the community; and
- Showing empathy towards other community members.
- Using trigger warnings (TW) to warn others of potentially distressing content. Common trigger warnings include: sexual assault, abuse, violence, self-harm, etc.

**Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to the following:**

- Public or private harassment;
- Abusive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, marital status, veteran’s status, immigration status, age, culture, body size, race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, career level, and/or socio-economic class;
- Use of profanity, insulting, and/or obscene language;
- Inappropriate use of sexualized language or imagery;
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission;
- Uninvited physical contact of any form; and
- Threats (implied or real) of, physical, professional or financial harm.

**Consequences of unacceptable behavior**

- Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to immediately cease and desist.
- Organizers may institute actions including immediate removal from an event, meeting, or space.

**Reporting unacceptable behavior:**

If you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or have witnessed any such behavior, please immediately notify a [Community Administrator](/getinvolved/communityadminstrators) in-person, by email, Slack (see **[Admin]** tag), and/or phone.

Anyone experiencing or witnessing behavior that constitutes an immediate or serious threat to public safety, or a criminal act, is expected to contact 911. Those witnessing a potential criminal act should also take actions necessary to maintain their own personal safety.

**Community Administrator responsibilities:**

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as administrators pledge to do our best to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Workspace administrators moderate the workspace, ensuring that members adhere to the above guidelines and maintaining the workspace structure and permissions behind-the-scenes. Administrators who do not follow or enforce the community guidelines in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other administrators.
