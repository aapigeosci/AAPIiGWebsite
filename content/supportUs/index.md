Asian American and Pacific Islanders in Geosciences (AAPIiG) strives to empower AAPIs in geosciences by creating a community of AAPI scientists across the country who support each other; celebrating AAPI culture; and advocating for justice, equity, diversity and inclusion issues in solidarity with other marginalized groups (see [Our Mission](/whoWeAre/ourMission)).

To do this, we need your help. Consider supporting our organization monetarily with a direct donation through PayPal or purchasing merchandise! Proceeds will be used to support various AAPIiG initiatives:

- Networking events for AAPI geoscientists, with special focus on students and early career researchers
- Travel scholarships to conferences
- Speaker honorariums
- Accessibility services (e.g., live captioning)
- General maintenance and upkeep costs (e.g., website hosting)
