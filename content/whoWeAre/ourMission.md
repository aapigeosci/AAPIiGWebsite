**Our Mission**

Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in Geosciences (AAPIiG) is a grassroots, member-driven organization committed to building a community that supports AAPIs within geosciences. The organization will:
- foster a sense of community among AAPI geoscientists;
- empower current and future AAPI geoscientists in their career goals within industry, academia, policy, non-profits, and beyond;
- embrace the diversity of both historical and contemporary experiences encompassed by communities grouped  together by the AAPI categorization; and
- advocate for justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion issues in solidarity with other marginalized groups, both within our disciplines and the world at large.

**What We Do**

To achieve our mission, the organization coordinates, maintains, and supports the following initiatives and activities:
- networking events for AAPI geoscientists to connect;
- a mentorship network for AAPI geoscientists across career stages and sectors;
- informational seminars and panels on AAPI issues and their relation to geosciences;
- community discussions that promote learning and catalyze collaborations amongst its diverse members;
- and more!

**Who is AAPIiG for?**

We welcome all geosciences community members who self-identify as Asian American and/or Pacific Islander, as well as individuals of Asian- and/or Pacific Islander-descent working in U.S.-based institutions. Community members include undergraduates, graduate students, recent graduates in transition, post-baccalaureate, and prospective students, postdocs, faculty, educators, administrators, industry and non-profit professionals, federal or state employees, researchers, retirees, and more. Please visit the [AAPIiG Slack](/getInvolved/Slack) page for further details.

Allies who are interested in learning more about AAPI issues are welcome to join our email lists to receive announcements, information on events, and guidance on ways to support the AAPIiG community.

We define geosciences broadly as any discipline related to the study of Earth and the environment, including but not limited to research areas commonly found in Earth science and geography departments (e.g., geology, oceanography, planetary science, atmospheric science, cryosphere science, environmental sciences, et cetera).
